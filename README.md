Gateway
=======

Daemon to manage the transition of (initially) software releases around a federated release management system according to a set of configurable security rules and filters.

Gateway - this is (very) prototype code, designed for a specific investigatory purpose. If you're not 100% sure if you should be using this code, then you shouldn't be.

This code isn't even intended to work fully at this stage, yet alone for use in any sort of production-like system.  When and if we move out of the "what-if" stage, we'll put a lot more information here.
