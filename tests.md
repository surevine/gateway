## Acceptance Tests ##

### Overview ###
This page will contain a number of acceptance tests relating to the gateway, the
purpose of which is verify high-level end-to-end functionality.

This is a living document, which will grow as new functionality is delivered
and new test cases are documented.

We have taken a lightweight approach here in order to maximise the amount of
resource available for development. As the project matures, more detailed
and/or formal test artefacts may be produced, and will be referenced here.
