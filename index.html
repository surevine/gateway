<h3><a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview">
  <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>Although these pages provide some general information about the Gateway, (for now) the
  primary purpose is to outline the test strategy and coding standards that will be
  adhered to, based on principles within the <a title="Government Service Design Manual" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual" target="_blank">Government Service Design Manual</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="test-strategy" class="anchor" href="#test-strategy">
  <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Strategy</h3>

<p>Test effort will be applied at three key levels; unit, integration and a
  combination of acceptance and exploratory testing, with the majority of
  automated test effort applied during unit and integration testing.</p>

<p>Whilst unit tests are predominantly focused on testing individual units of
  source code, integration tests will be written to verify combinations or
  interactions between software modules, components and services. Both unit and
  integration tests will become assets of the Gateway project, will be
  self-documenting, and will be executed regularly (via shared continuous
  integration tools) to provide fast and cost-effective feedback.</p>

<p><p class="view"><a href="tests.html">Acceptance tests</a> will be written (documented) to verify high-level
  functionality end-to-end (e.g. exercising key flows of a use case).
  Acceptance tests may be automated (if appropriate) and will be provided to
  aid in the delivery of SAT (Site Acceptance Testing).</p>

<p>To accompany unit, integration and acceptance tests, exploratory test
  sessions will be conducted to find and test less obvious outcomes. These
  sessions will be time-boxed, and where defects are uncovered, either
  automated or manual tests will be written to ensure they are not repeated
  in subsequent iterations.</p>

<h3><a name="code-quality" class="anchor" href="#code-quality">
  <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Quality</h3>

<p>Alongside code quality standards, an appropriate code coverage
  metric will be established to guide the level of unit and
  integration testing. These metrics will be recorded and published
  as part of the project documentation and tracked via
  a continuous integration platform, along with other static
  analysis reports and measures to ensure the appropriate level of
  code quality is met. These measures will be established on a per
  project basis and reported on as part of a fortnightly sprint
  process.

  Our configurations and templates for these measures will be made
  available upon request.</p>
